# Ecosystems

Defined as:

    - an interacting group of natural elements and the organisms in the environment.
    - a unit of interrelationships between and among living (biotic) and non-living components (abiotic).
    - the biotic components respond and adapt to the abiotic components in their environment to maintain their homeostasis, or their steady state condition.


## Biotic Components

#### Autotrophs (Producers)
- are organisms which produce organic nutrients for their own use and indirectly for all other members of the ecosystem with the use of inorganic nutrients and an outside energy source.

    - includes bacteria, protists, algae, fungi, plants, and even animals.
    - maybe photosynthetic and chemosynthetic

#### Heterotrophs (Consumers)
- organisms that need a preformed source of organic nutrients.
- are also called **consumers**

    - include herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.

#### Decomposers
- use their enzymatic secretions to chemically break down dead organic matter and produce detritus.

## Abiotic Components

### Sunlight

Long day plants: produce flowers only when the lengthening days reach a critical point, after the summer solstice.

Short day plants: produce flowers after the winter solstice.

- Sunlight can be classified into:
    - Crepuscular (twilight)
    - Diurnal (day)
    - Nocturnal (night)

### Water

- an agent of weathering
    - Hydrophytes (aquatic plants)
    - Mesophytes (terrestial plants that need moderate amount of water)
    - Epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants)
    - Xerophytes (plants that can survive with little amount of water)
    - Halophytes (salt-tolerant plants)


### Temperature

- Poikilotherms (cold-blooded animals)
- Homeotherms (warm-blooded animals)

### Soil Horizons

| Layer | Definitions |
| :---: | :---------  |
|   O   | Decomposed material; humus or organic |
|   A   | Leached mineral horizon with high content of organic matter; topsoil |
|   E   | Eluviated horizon |
|   B   | Zone of accumulation of fine materials and mineral precipitates; subsoil |
|   C   | Partly weathered rock; parent material |
|   R   | Hard bedrock; bedrock |
