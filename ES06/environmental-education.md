# Environmental Education

- It is process by which people develop awareness, concern, and knowledge of the environment and learn to use this understanding to preserve, conserve, and utilize the environment in a sustainable manner for the benefit of the present and future generation.

**Intended for all types of learners**
- Students
- Out-of-school youth
- Community leaders
- Policy makers
- General public

## Beliefs

Environmental is rooted in the beliefs that :

    - Humans can live compatibly with nature
    - Humans can act equitably with each other
    - A human's well-being is inextricably bound with environmental quality
    - We and the systems we create impact the total environment
    - People can make informed decisions that consider future generations
    - Critical and creative thinking, decision making, and communcation, as well as collaborative learning must be emphasized, and essential for active and meaningful learning.


## Environmental Science

`The systematic study of the environment and our place in it`

- It is highly interdisciplinary (Biology, Chemistry, Geography, Agriculture, and many other fields).
- It also incorporates knowledge of social organization, politics, and the humanities.
- It is mission-oriented.

Enviromental science uses methods to investigate problems and to provide answers to the said problems.

A sequence of steps and processes is used to gain a better understanding through gatherin information by means of observation and experiemntation is what is known as the Scientific Method.


## Scientific Method

- Observation
    - may be based or through your readings

- Define/State the Problem/Question
    - the problem is based on the observed event; Why does it occur?

- Formulate Hypotheses
    - the scientific guess/the possible answer to the problem

- Test the Hypothesis/Experimentation
    - this is to verify whether to accept the hypothesis or to reject the hypothesis

- Formulate a Conclusion
    - the conclusion is based on the results of the experimentation; it is a statement whether the hypothesis is accepted or not


## An Overview of Ecology

> Ecology comes from the Greek terms: *oikos* (house/dwelling) and *logos* (discourse/study of)

- It is the study of distribution, abundance, relations, and the interactions of organism with each other and their environment.

*Ecology is the study of ecosystems*

    - An ecosystem is a system consisting of biotic and abiotic components that function together as a unit

    - An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other organisms, as well as weather and landscapes, work together to form a bubble of life.

    - A multidisciplinary science

### Organization of Ecology

    Characteristics of Life
        - Organization 
        - Growth and Development
        - Reproduction
        - Heredity
        - Metabolism
        - Response to the environment
        - Adaptation to the environment

#### Levels of Ecology

    - Biosphere
        - Region of the Earth's crust, waters, and atmosphere inhabited by living things
    
    - Ecosystem
        - The atmosphere and different communities interacting with both its physical and biological environment

    - Community
        - A group of different populations distributed into specific geographical area

    - Population
        - A group of the same species occupying a certain geographic area and time

    - Species
        - Organisms that are capable of interbreeding with one another

    - Organism
        - Individuals that contain organ systems
    
    - Organ
        - Composed of a number of tissues and organized for a particular task
    
    - Tissue
        - A group of cells with a common structure and function

    - Cell
        - A smallest unit of a living thing

    - Molecule
        - Sallest unit of a compound that still has the properties of the compound

    - Atom
        - Smallest unit of a molecule
